# Welcome to Sam C.'s Portfolio

This site showcases my data science and analytics-related academic projects, work projects, and passion projects. My consolidated github repository for these projects can be found [here](https://github.com/samuelco1997/Portfolio), and the links to each can be found below for easier access:

## ðŸ”¬ Projects

- [**Predicting Graduation Rates with Regression-type ML Models**](https://github.com/samuelco1997/Portfolio/tree/main/Predicting%20Graduation%20Rates%20with%20Regression-type%20ML%20Models)

For this personal portfolio project, I aimed to create an algorithm that could predict the 4-year graduation rate of higher education institutions using various performance metrics (school composition, enrollment and graduation rates, demographics, test scores, and more). A hyperparameter tuned XGBoost model showed the highest performance (MAE = 4.21, RMSE = 5.70).

- [**Classifying Election Violence using Random Forests**](https://github.com/samuelco1997/Portfolio/tree/main/Classifying%20Election%20Violence%20using%20ML%20in%20Python)

In this project for my Data Science II class, I created models that could classify the likelihood of instances of electoral violence using random forest algorithms. A random forest model was fit to the data, yielding an accuracy score of 0.85 and a F1 score of 0.78.

- [**Dog Whistle Detection Classifier with LLMs and Word Embeddings**](https://github.com/samuelco1997/Portfolio/tree/main/Dog%20Whistle%20Detection%20with%20LLM-Generated%20Word%20Embeddings)

For this project in my Neural Networks class, I attempted to create a dog whistle classification system using LLM-generated word embeddings from the DistilBERT transformer, in combination with traditional supervised learning techniques, namely K-Nearest Neighbor and Logistic Regression. Results were promising, with accuracy and F1 scores above 0.90.

- [**World Health & Happiness Dashboard in Tableau**](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam8656/viz/Worldhealthandhappiness/Dashboard1)

This dashboard is the final product of my Google Data Analytics Certificate coursework. It shows health and happiness metrics across the world, pre-pandemic. My credentials for this certificate can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/9QY9C49T9SJP?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=pdf_header_button&utm_product=prof).
